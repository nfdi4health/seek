Hi,

The request to join a <%= t('project') %> has been responded to and rejected by <%= @responder.name %>.

The <%= t('project') %> joined is '<%= @project.title %>' ( <%= project_url(@project) %> ), and was requested by
'<%= @requester.name %>' ( <%= person_url(@requester) %> ).

It was rejected with the comment: `<%= @comments %>`.

This is an automated email.
